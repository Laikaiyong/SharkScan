# SharkScan
Sharks, crucial to healthy oceans, are getting snagged in fishing gear by the millions. This "bycatch" is driving them towards extinction, messing up the whole marine ecosystem, and even hurting fishing profits. We need to act now, with smarter gear, better fishing practices, and close watch on what's getting caught. Otherwise, our oceans will be missing their most important players. Simple. Direct. Time to save the sharks.


Sharks have been endangered for many decades. But not anymore, introducing SharkScan! A platform that allows you to identify presence of shark groups and other marine life to prevent bycatch of these beautiful species.


## Usage
Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```
